Steps
1. Clone the repo
2. Set up a pythonanywhere account (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
3. Host the files on pythonanywhere (https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/)
3a. Add a new web app
3b. Select Flask and an appropriate Python version (3+)
3c. The Flask app is called app.pythonanywhere
3d. Install dependencies through the Bash console and virtual environment: pip install -r requirements.txt
3e. Configure WSGI if needed
3f. Load web app

Notes
- Error messages are directly printed onto the UI which is not good security practice. But this is open-source anyway so...
